For create and delete inode:
- Readerlock all of the inodes up until you hit the parent inode of the target (i.e. FS_DIRENTRY), continue traversing, etc
- Remember to do hand-over-hand locking while traversing
- When you hit the parent inode of the target, writerlock it, readerunlock previous inode
- Then just do the create/delete call
- When finished, writerunlock

For read and write:
- Readerlock all of the inodes up until you hit the the target (i.e. FS_DIRENTRY[i or something]), continue traversing, etc
- Remember to do hand-over-hand locking while traversing
- When you hit the inode of the target, writerlock it if its a write call and readerunlock the previous inode, or just pass the readerlock from the previous inode if its a read call
- Then just do the write/read call
- When finished, writerunlock if its a write call, readerunlock if its a read call
